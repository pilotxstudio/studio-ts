who we share it with, and the controls you have over your data.

We only collect the information we need to deliver our services, run and improve our products, and
communicate with you. We process personal data in accordance with applicable law (including EU GDPR
where relevant) and take reasonable technical and organisational steps to protect it.

If you have questions or want to exercise your rights (access, correction, deletion, portability, or
to object), email us at privacy@pilotxstudio.com. We’ll respond promptly and clearly.

## 4. How We Obtain Your Data

We believe in transparency, respect, and ethical handling of personal
data. We do not use invasive tracking techniques or dark patterns to trick you into sharing data.
Our goal is to provide a seamless digital experience while respecting your privacy. To do so we
collect your personal data in two ways:

+ **You provide it to us** – for example, when you fill out a contact form, apply for a job, subscribe to
our newsletter, browse our website, or contact us directly through third-party platforms. If you
reach out via LinkedIn or similar services and request us to contact you, we will also store your
details in our CRM in order to manage the conversation.

+ **We receive it from third parties** – we obtain general, anonymized data about browsing behavior and
location via Google Analytics.


## 4. What data we collect


+ **4.1 Website Visitors**
  + **4.1.1 Functionele cookies**

  Our website uses functional cookies to ensure it works quickly and
  efficiently. Caching, for example, helps speed up your browsing experience. These cookies do not
  track personal data and help the website to function properly. You can delete these cookies from
  your own device.

  + **4.1.2 Analytical cookies:**

  Additionally, we use Google Analytics to analyze general usage patterns on
  an anonymized basis. Since they have minimal impact on your privacy and keep your identity
  anonymous, they do not require consent.

  These include:
    + Your IP address (which Google shortens for anonymity)
    + What pages you visit and for how long
    + The device and browser you use

    This data helps us optimize our website performance and user experience. If you prefer not to be
    tracked by Google Analytics, you can opt-out via Google’s [opt-out tool](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

    We currently do not use a cookie consent banner but will update this statement if our use of
    cookies changes in the future.

+ **4.2 Contact Form**

When you reach out via our contact form, we ask for: Your name, company name(optional for
individuals), email address and your message. We use this data to respond to your request. Simple as
that.

+ **4.3 Job Applications**

If you apply for a job with us, we collect:

Your name, your LinkedIn profile, your email address, your message, your
resume and portfolio link. We keep this information for a maximum of 30 days, or until the position
has been filled, at which point we delete the information. If you want us to remove your data
earlier, just email us at hi@pilotxstudio.com.

+ **4.4 Newsletter**

If you sign up for our newsletter, we collect: Your name, your email address.

Our newsletter is sent via Pipedrive and email marketing solutions such as Mailchimp, which also
tracks open and click rates. This helps us improve our content. You can unsubscribe anytime via the
link in our emails.


## 5. Who We Share Data With

We do not sell your data. However, we use third-party tools to improve our services. These tools
process data on our behalf, but they do not have permission to use it for their own purposes. Here’s
how we use them:

+ **Google Analytics** (to improve website performance)
+ **Google Suite** (for email communication and document storage)
+ **PipeDrive** our CRM system (for handling inquiries, job applications, sending newsletters and tracking engagement)
+ **Mailchimp** or other email marketing solutions (to send our newsletters)


## 6. How We Protect Your Data

We take data security seriously and implement measures to safeguard your personal information from
unauthorized access, loss, misuse or alteration. In addition to the security protocols enforced by
our third-party tools, we have enabled two-factor authentication (2FA) on these platforms to enhance
protection. Access to tools such as Google Analytics is restricted to authorized personnel within
our organization only.

## 7. Use Of Data For Internal Projects

In addition to working with clients, PilotX Studio also explores and develops its own (digital)
products and services. This means that data collected through our website and other interactions may
be used to assess interest in new projects, improve our offerings, or communicate about initiatives
that are part of PilotX Studio.

If any internal projects require additional data processing, we will provide clear information on
how this data is used and ensure compliance with privacy regulations. If these projects operate as a
new venture under separate brands or websites, they will have their own privacy statements where
needed.

If a new venture is closely related to PilotX Studio’s existing activities, we may use collected
data to support its development. In such cases, we will inform affected users in advance and provide
an option to opt out. If the venture explores new domains outside PilotX Studio’s core services, any
transferred data will first be anonymized so that it is no longer personally identifiable.

## 8. Data Retention

We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was
collected, in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements. Below is an overview of how long we
keep different types of data:

+ Website analytics data is anonymized and stored by Google.
+ Emails in Google Suite are kept indefinitely.
+ WIthin Pipedrive:
  + CRM records are kept indefinitely.
  + Job applications are kept for a maximum of 30 days, or until the position is filled.
+ Within Pipedrive and email marketing solutions such as Mailchimp:
  + Newsletter data remains until you unsubscribe.

## 9. Your Rights

You have rights over your data. Specifically, you can:

+ Request access to the data we have on you
+ Ask us to correct inaccurate data
+ Ask us to delete your data
+ Object to certain processing activities

client collaboration. Any major changes will be reflected in this Privacy Statement. If we update
this Privacy Statement, we’ll put the new version on our website. We recommend you to check for
updates regularly.
