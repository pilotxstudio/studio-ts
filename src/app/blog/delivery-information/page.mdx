## Overview

At PilotX Studio we deliver digital products, design assets and engineering work in ways that make handovers fast, repeatable and low-friction. This page explains how we deliver work, what to expect from timelines and handoffs, how acceptance and revisions work, and what support we provide after delivery.

## Typical delivery methods

We use the delivery channel that best fits the project and your stack. Common methods include:

* Shared Git repositories (GitHub, GitLab) with branches, tags and release notes.
* Design handoff through Figma links and export packs (SVG, PNG, PDF, design tokens).
* Downloadable archives for builds and assets (ZIP, tar.gz) stored on secure file hosting (S3 / private CDN).
* Docker images or container registries for deployable services.
* Staging and production deployments to your cloud environment (AWS, GCP, Azure) or to hosting accounts you provide.
* Project documentation, runbooks and deployment instructions delivered as Markdown, PDF or internal wiki pages.

We’ll agree the exact channel in the proposal or SOW so there are no surprises at handoff.

## Delivery schedule & milestones

* Each project includes a timeline in the SOW with milestones, estimated delivery dates and acceptance points.
* Milestone dates are estimates and depend on timely client feedback and any third-party approvals. Major delays caused by missing input may push the schedule and will be communicated immediately.
* Where faster delivery is required, we can offer an expedited timeline subject to resource availability and an adjusted fee.

## What you’ll receive at handoff

Depending on the project, a typical handoff package includes:

* Final source code in a Git repo with tags and setup instructions.
* Design files and assets (Figma links, artboards, icons, exported assets and style guide).
* A packaged build (static site, compiled app, Docker image).
* Technical documentation: architecture summary, API docs, environment variables, runbook for deployment and rollback.
* Test results and known issues list.
* License and IP transfer statement (once final payment is received).
* Optional: onboarding session or recorded walkthrough.

## Acceptance & revisions

* Each milestone will include a defined acceptance window (usually 5–10 business days) during which you can review the deliverable and request reasonable corrections.
* Minor revisions (UI tweaks, bug fixes within scope) are included as specified in the SOW. Significant scope changes will be handled via a change order and may affect cost and timeline.
* Once a deliverable is accepted in writing (email or project tracker), it is considered final for that milestone.

## Deployments & hosting handover

* We can deploy to client environments or deploy to our staging environment and coordinate your deployment. The proposal will clarify responsibilities.
* For deployments to your accounts, you must provide access credentials or temporary provisioning rights in advance. We recommend short-lived access tokens and following your internal security policies.
* We provide deployment/runbook documentation to make future deployments repeatable.

## Post-delivery support & maintenance

* We offer optional maintenance and support plans (bug fixes, minor feature work, security patches) billed monthly or on a time-and-materials basis. Details and SLAs are listed in the SOW or support agreement.
* After handover, we provide a limited warranty period for defects (e.g., 30 days) as defined in your contract. Critical issues will be prioritized according to the agreed support tier.

## File formats & ownership

* Deliverables will be provided in industry-standard, editable formats (source code, Figma, Sketch exports, PSD/AI if used). If you require a specific format, tell us during scoping.
* Ownership of final deliverables transfers to you upon full payment, except for our pre-existing tools, libraries and third-party components (these are licensed, not sold). See the IP section in the Terms of Service for details.

## Change requests & scope creep

* Requests outside the agreed scope are handled as change requests. We’ll provide an estimate and revised timeline for approval. Work on approved change requests begins after written sign-off.
* We track scope changes transparently in the project board so budget and timeline impacts are clear.

## Security, backups & sensitive data

* We follow standard security practices: encrypted storage for credentials, least-privilege access, and secure transfer channels (SFTP / HTTPS).
* We recommend clients provide test accounts and not share production credentials until needed. When production access is required, we prefer short-lived credentials.
* We keep backups of deliverables for a reasonable period; long-term retention and backup arrangements can be included in a maintenance agreement.

## International delivery & services

* We deliver work globally and may use international hosting and CI/CD providers. Any third-party fees, data transfer considerations or local taxes are outlined in the proposal.
* If your project involves regulated data (HIPAA, GDPR-sensitive datasets, financial data), notify us at scoping so we can include the appropriate contractual and technical safeguards.

## Delays, force majeure & cancellations

* We’ll notify you promptly if we foresee delays. If either party needs to pause or cancel work, the termination and refund terms in the proposal and Terms of Service apply.
* We aren’t liable for delays caused by force majeure events (natural disasters, strikes, government actions) but will work with you to resume work as soon as practical.

## Pricing & invoicing related to delivery

* Final delivery and IP transfer are conditional on full payment per the payment terms in the SOW.
* Additional costs for expedited delivery, third-party licenses or new infrastructure will be invoiced separately with your prior approval.

## Common FAQs (quick)

**Q: How will I get my code and assets?**
A: We push code to the agreed Git repo, share Figma links for design, and provide a ZIP or cloud link for packaged assets plus documentation.

**Q: Can you deploy to our cloud account?**
A: Yes — we’ll coordinate access and deploy following your environment and security rules.

**Q: What if I need a small update after delivery?**
A: Small fixes within the warranty period are handled per the SOW. For ongoing work we offer retainers or hourly support.

## Contact & escalation

For delivery questions, handoff requests or urgent deployment help, contact us:
**[delivery@pilotxstudio.com](mailto:delivery@pilotxstudio.com)** or your project lead listed in the SOW. If you don’t receive a response within 48 hours for non-urgent matters, escalate to **[ops@pilotxstudio.com](mailto:ops@pilotxstudio.com)** (replace with your preferred addresses).
